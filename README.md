# Screecher	

### What is it?
Screecher is a simple web app that lets you search for Twitter hashtags and gives you the most recent Tweets with that hashtag. 
It's called "Screecher" because I had the idea to use a bat as the logo, and bats screech.

### Why is it?
Iâ€™m building this as a personal project to build upon my knowledge and skills with React, API integration, and accessibility.

### You will see:
	* Search Bar.
	* Dark Mode Toggle
	* List of Tweets.
